This is a small todo list.

With the Init Version this is possible:
-Add, Delete and Complete (check) todos
-Saves progress for the next session
-For now only I can use it because there is no log in or registration

Features that i want to add:
-Pomodoro style learn clock that helps with time tracking and focus times.
-Reward System with a Free Time Clock for completed tasks and completed hours learned/worked on tasks
-User Log in and registration for managing own tasks
